# Why Arank ?
---
### 1. Built From Scratch

Arank has been written from scratch, making it more stable and less of crashes.

### 2. Better Error Handling

Error handling been done in the best way possible, such that the bot doesn't crash and stop all of a sudden.

### 3. Lightweight

Arank has minimal amount of plugins (just the necessary ones) in the main repository, and all the other less-usefull stuff in the addons repository. This facilitates quick deployments and lag free use.

### 4. Install any plugin

Arank can install any plugin from the most of the other 'userbots' without any issue.

### 5. Safety First

Arank warns you when you try to install/execute dangerous stuff (people nowadays make plugins to hack user accounts, Arank is safe)

### 6. Multi-Language Support

Currently We Have 22 Language Support, More will be added Soon üòÅ.

### 7. Many Cool Features

### 8. py-Arank

We have managed to pack the core into a pip package, Check it out [`py-Arank`](https://pypi.org/project/py-Arank/).
